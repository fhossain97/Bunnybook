# Bunnybook
Bunnybook is a playful take on the ever so popular Facebook. Instead of connecting humans together, Bunnybook connects all bunnies together. Each bunny is able to login/logout via token and GitHub authentication. Bunny users can create, update, and delete their posts and can upload images as well. Additionally, bunnies are able to message one another just like facebook!
